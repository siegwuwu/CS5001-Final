# Final Project Report

* Student Name: Chen Wu
* Github Username: siegwuwu
* Semester: 23Fall
* Course: CS5001



## Description 
The final project focuses on building a stock analysis application. It uses the concept of moving averages to guide the trading strategy of the current day (as the data we use is the daily price). The selection of this topic results from a combination of personal trading experience as well as interest in the application of computer science in the finance field.

## Key Features
Highlight some key features of this project that you want to show off/talk about/focus on. 

The key feature of this application is the calculation of simple moving average (SMA). SMA is the average of the prices of the x days before the current day with the x days being specified by the user based. By comparing the current day price with the SMA, one can understand if a datum is high, low, or equal compared with the SMA. The strategy is to buy a stock on the day when the price turns larger than its SMA or vice versa. This allows the user to buy in when the trend of the price turns into increasing trend, sell when the trend becomes a decreasing trend, and hold for any other time.

## Guide
How do we run your project? What should we do to see it in action? - Note this isn't installing, this is actual use of the project.. If it is a website, you can point towards the gui, use screenshots, etc talking about features. 


## Installation Instructions
If we wanted to run this project locally, what would we need to do?  If we need to get API key's include that information, and also command line startup commands to execute the project. If you have a lot of dependencies, you can also include a requirements.txt file, but make sure to include that we need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or something similar.

## Code Review
Go over key aspects of code in this section. Both link to the file, include snippets in this report (make sure to use the [coding blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).  Grading wise, we are looking for that you understand your code and what you did. 

### Major Challenges
Key aspects could include pieces that your struggled on and/or pieces that you are proud of and want to show off.


## Example Runs
Explain how you documented running the project, and what we need to look for in your repository (text output from the project, small videos, links to videos on youtube of you running it, etc)

## Testing
How did you test your code? What did you do to make sure your code was correct? If you wrote unit tests, you can link to them here. If you did run tests, make sure you document them as text files, and include them in your submission. 

> _Make it easy for us to know you *ran the project* and *tested the project* before you submitted this report!_


## Missing Features / What's Next
Focus on what you didn't get to do, and what you would do if you had more time, or things you would implement in the future. 

## Final Reflection
Write at least a paragraph about your experience in this course. What did you learn? What do you need to do to learn more? Key takeaways? etc.
